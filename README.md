# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Udacity DAND Project

The dataset that was wrangled, analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog

**PROJECT DETAILS:**

An Enhanced Twitter Archive has been provided by Udacity to facilitate Wrangling process, the archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which was used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, the archive was filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).

Additionally, Udacity provided an image predictions file that can classify breeds of dogs. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).

It is part of the requirements for this project to gather additional data via the Twitter API Tweepy and store the Retweet Count and Favorite Count of the tweets provided in the Enhanced Twitter Archive. The gathering of this data has been performed in this project.
